Weather API Webpage
Developed a dynamic Weather API Webpage that provides real-time weather information based on user-input location. By integrating with a weather API, the application fetches and displays current temperature, 
humidity percentage, and wind speed details. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates my ability to work with APIs and handle asynchronous data fetching. The Weather API Webpage offers 
users accurate and up-to-date weather details, enhancing their ability to plan daily activities accordingly.
